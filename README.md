# Assignment 3: Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

This repository contains the implementation of:

- Randomized Quicksort and Deterministic Quicksort
- Hash Table with Chaining

## Folder Structure

- `quicksort/`: Implementations of both randomized and deterministic quicksort.
- `hashtable/`: Hash table implementation using chaining for collision resolution.
- `main.py`: Runs sample tests on both algorithms.

## To Run

```bash
python main.py
